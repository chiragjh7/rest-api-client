## Overview  
**RESTful API Client** is a simple and lightweight RESTful API built using the Express.js framework and Mongoose. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on Product and Category database through a series of HTTP requests. 

##  Features  
* **Create** - Create a new product and category using a POST request .  
* **Read** - Read an existing product and category(if exist) using a GET request.
* **Update** - Update an existing product using a PUT request.
* **Delete** - Delete an existing product using a DELETE request.
* **Error Handling** - Handle errors and return appropriate responses.

##  Installation and Usage 
* Clone this repository:  
`$ git clone https://github.com/chiragjh7/rest-api-client/ `
* Install dependencies using:  
`$ npm install `
* Create a `.env` file with your database URL and other environment variables.
* Start the server:  
`$ npm start `

The server should now be running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/). You can test the API using a tool like Postman or Thunder-client.

##  Configuration

The following environment variables need to be set for the project to run:

-   `MONGODB_URI`: The URI for the MongoDB database.
-   `PORT`: The port number on which the server will run.
